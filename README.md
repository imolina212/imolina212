### ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŒŽ

I am a recent graduate of Pursuit, an intensive 12-month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate as I navigate through a career change in order to pursue one of my lifelong affinities. Ive always had a passion for problem solving activities that range anywhere from math to playing strategical games/puzzles. Naturally, those interests led me to being curious about how games, apps and websites work under the hood. My goal is to have a successful career in the tech industry where I can help contribute to positive, impactful change. Outside of coding you can find me staying active through sports, exercising, or hiking.
